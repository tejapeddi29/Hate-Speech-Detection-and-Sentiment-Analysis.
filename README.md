# Hate-Speech-Detection-and-Sentiment-Analysis.

### 1. Introducton
Social media plaQorms such as TwiSer, Reddit, etc. have become significant sources of
informa-on and plaQorms for public expression. However, the open and unrestricted nature
of these plaQorms has also given rise to the prolifera-on of hate speech. Hate speech,
characterized by offensive, discriminatory, or derogatory language targe-ng individuals or
groups based on aSributes such as race, religion, gender, or sexual orienta-on, poses a serious
threat to online communi-es. It not only fosters a toxic environment but also contributes to
real-world harm, division, and social unrest. Detec-ng and comba-ng hate speech on TwiSer
is crucial to promote a safe and inclusive digital space where users can freely engage and share
ideas. In this project, I propose to develop a hate speech detec-on model using the VADER
(Valence Aware Dic-onary and sEn-ment Reasoner) sen-ment analysis tool.
2. Problem Statement
The problem we address is the iden-fica-on and classifica-on of hate speech on TwiSer. Hate
speech on social media plaQorms has become a pervasive issue, impac-ng individuals and
communi-es by perpetua-ng discrimina-on, inci-ng violence, and crea-ng an environment
of fear and hos-lity. Detec-ng hate speech manually is a daun-ng task due to the vast amount
of content generated on TwiSer every day. Consequently, automa-ng the process of hate
speech detec-on becomes impera-ve to efficiently iden-fy and address instances of hate
speech, facilita-ng -mely interven-ons and ensuring the well-being and safety of TwiSer
users. By leveraging the power of natural language processing and sen-ment analysis
techniques, we seek to develop a hate speech detec-on model that can effec-vely iden-fy
and flag tweets containing hate speech, enabling the implementa-on of proac-ve measures
to mi-gate its harmful effects.
