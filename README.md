# Hate-Speech-Detection-and-Sentiment-Analysis.

### 1. Introducton
###Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, etc. have become significant sources of
information and platforms for public expression. However, the open and unrestricted nature
of these platforms has also given rise to the proliferation of hate speech. Hate speech,
characterized by offensive, discriminatory, or derogatory language targeting individuals or
groups based on aSributes such as race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation, poses a serious
threat to online communities. It not only fosters a toxic environment but also contributes to
real-world harm, division, and social unrest. Detecting and combating hate speech on Twitter
is crucial to promote a safe and inclusive digital space where users can freely engage and share
ideas. In this project, I propose to develop a hate speech detection model using the VADER
(Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool.
